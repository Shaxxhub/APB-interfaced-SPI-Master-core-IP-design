# APB-interfaced-SPI-Master-core-IP-design
Maven Silicon internship Project (May 2025 - June 2025)

In modern embedded systems and SoC (System-on-Chip) 
designs, efficient and reliable communication between the 
processor and peripheral devices is essential. Serial Peripheral 
Interface (SPI) is a popular synchronous serial communication 
protocol used for short-distance communication due to its high 
speed and simplicity. It is commonly used to interface 
microcontrollers with external devices such as sensors, memory 
chips, ADCs, DACs, and display controllers. 
Unlike asynchronous protocols, SPI uses a master-slave 
architecture with dedicated lines for clock (SCLK), data 
transmission (MOSI), data reception (MISO), and slave selection 
(SS). SPI enables full-duplex communication, allowing 
simultaneous data transfer between the master and slave, 
controlled by a serial clock generated by the master. 
This project focuses on the design and Verilog implementation of 
an SPI Master IP Core that can be integrated into digital systems 
using an APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) interface. The SPI 
Master core supports key features such as configurable clock 
polarity and phase, programmable baud rate, MSB/LSB-first 
transmission, multiple slave support, automatic slave selects, and 
interrupt generation. 
The implementation is modular, consisting of key blocks such as 
the baud rate generator, APB slave interface, shift register, and 
SPI control logic. Simulation and verification are performed to 
ensure the correct functionality of the design, making it suitable 
for integration in real-time VLSI and embedded applications.
